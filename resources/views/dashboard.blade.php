<h1>welcome</h1>


<p>This is Atlassian's public issue tracker for Jira,
<br> Confluence, Bitbucket, and other Atlassian products.<br>


If that is not what you were looking for, please see<br>
 our Community, Documentation and Support sites.</p>

 <h1>Search For Issues</h1>

 <p>When your idea or problem has already been reported
 <br> it's much better to add your vote rather than create a
 <br> new issue</p>
 <p>If you already know your way around Jira searches and the<br>
  Jira Query Language (JQL) then go straight to Search.</p>

  <p>New to Atlassian products and/or Jira?
  <br> Use the links at right to get started.</p>
  <p>When you have found an issue you can add yourself 
  <p>as a Watcher to get updates and add your vote to <br>
   help our product teams prioritize.</p>


  	<h1 style="text-align: center; margin-top:-39%" >Report a Bug</h1>

  	<p style="text-align: center;margin-right:10%;">Thank you for taking the time to tell us!<br>
    <a  style="color: blue" href="/bug-activity">Create an issue<a/> in our support system and our Support <br>engineers will confirm the problem,<br> collect full details, and report it to development.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;margin-right:10%;">For more information about how we prioritize
<br> fixes, see our bug fix policies for Server, Cloud and Security.
